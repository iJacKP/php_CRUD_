# php_CRUD_
Just some practices with Php.
I was trying to learn how to do a CRUD in php , so i followed a tutorial on Youtube by Nitish Kumar, 
here the link to the playlist : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXbYsh3rUPSxsOtkLVmpPrgilYNR8I7r4 . 


To it works you need to create a data base in phpMyAdmin ,and then you have to create a table called product with 
the following structure : id (INT - beign primary key), name(VARCHAR-32),price(INT)and description (VARCHAR-502). 
After you've created you need to make your configuration on the file "db.php" , you need to put your user,pass and also put the name of your Data base.
